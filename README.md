#Privacy Friendly WiFi
##Overview
The intent of this Android app is to provide a possibility to (de-) activate WiFi according to preset rules.
Triggers include cell location and a time schedule.
##Motivation
As it is developed as a practical work for the SECUSO research group of the Technische Universtität Darmstadt in Germany, the main motivation lies in providing a useful app with focus on using minimum rights. This also implies, that we put a stress on preserving the user´s privacy.
##Installation
You can clone this repository and build the app using android-studio. You can also use Marketplaces like F-Droid or Google Play (future).
