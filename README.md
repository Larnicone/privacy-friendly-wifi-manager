# Privacy Friendly WiFi Manager
This app helps you automatically turning on/off your Wi-Fi while you are not near a known WiFi. The intent of this Android app is to provide a possibility to (de-) activate WiFi according to preset rules. Triggers include cell location and a time schedule.

## Motivation
By switching of the Wi-Fi when it is not required, so called tracking via Wi-Fi is avoided. Privacy Friendly WiFi Manager also saves battery life by automatically disabling your phone´s Wi-Fi in case it is not near an already known Wi-Fi network. As it is developed as a practical work for the SECUSO research group of the Technische Universtität Darmstadt in Germany, the main motivation lies in providing a useful app using minimum permissions. This also implies that we put a stress on preserving the user´s privacy.
